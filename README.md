The solution for the first exercise of the 2016 IT State exam (Lithuania) (Retake session) Check Project\main.cpp

Task:
There are certain number of students. The list of students’ heights is given. You have to write an algorithm (program) which will calculate the average of all heights and will return the result as an integer. This program should also calculate how many students are taller than the average and return this as the second integer in the output file.
Data:
Data (student list) have to be given as the separate .txt file (U1.txt file). First line of this file is the number of students, and all other lines are the students’ heights.
Results:
Results must be in the U1rez.txt file. There should be two integers (first is the average value and second one is the number of students who are taller than the average).
Additional information and restrictions:
You are NOT allowed to use any kind of arrays. You have to use more than one function. You are not allowed to perform any actions with command line.
